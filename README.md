# 💹 Crypto Asset Dashboard

**👤 Name:** Peram Ranjith  
**🌐 Live Demo (optional):** _[Add Vercel or Netlify link if deployed]_

## 📌 What I Built

A responsive, interactive React dashboard that fetches real-time crypto data from CoinGecko. Users can select a cryptocurrency to view its price, volume, market cap, 24-hour changes, and a 7-day historical price chart.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios
- Chart.js + react-chartjs-2
- CoinGecko API

## 🎨 UI Decisions

- Clean dark mode UI with gradient headers
- Responsive design using Tailwind
- Chart component for historical data
- Modular components for maintainability

## 🚀 What I'd Improve With More Time

- Add a full search input for any crypto asset
- Support time range toggle (1D, 7D, 30D)
- Add AI summary using Gemini or OpenAI
- Add unit tests and deploy to Vercel
